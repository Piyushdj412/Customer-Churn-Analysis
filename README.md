📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Data-Driven Insights for Retention

🚀 Overview
This project explores customer churn in a telecom company, leveraging data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualizations to identify key factors influencing customer retention. The findings provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

🔍 Key Findings & Insights
📌 1. Customer Churn Distribution
Overall Churn Rate: 26.5% of customers have left, highlighting retention challenges.
Senior Citizens face a 42% churn rate, much higher than non-senior customers (24%).

📌 2. Service-Related Factors Affecting Churn
Lack of Key Services Increases Churn:
No Online Security → 45% churn (vs. 15% with security).
No Tech Support → 43% churn (vs. 14% with support).
Contract Type Plays a Major Role:
Monthly contracts → 60% churn rate, while 2-year contracts → only 3% churn.
Fiber Optic Internet → 42% churn rate, much higher than DSL (26%).

📌 3. Financial Insights
Customers spending < $1000 → 50% churn rate, while long-term customers spending > $5000 have only 5% churn.
Electronic check users → 45% churn, much higher than credit card (15%) or bank transfers (11%).

📈 Data & Visualizations
Count Plots, Pie Charts, and Bar Graphs illustrate churn trends across demographics and services.
Boxplots & Histograms reveal financial patterns and tenure-based customer behavior.

🎯 Actionable Recommendations
✔ Encourage long-term contracts through discounts & loyalty programs.
✔ Promote security & tech support to high-risk customers.
✔ Bundle streaming services to increase engagement.
✔ Encourage credit card/bank payments to reduce churn linked to payment failures.
